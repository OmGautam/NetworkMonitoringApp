# NetworkMonitoringApp
Developed a program to capture network packet data and display it with data visualization using Python and JavaScript. This program traces packets from an interface on any given laptop and converts the captured data into a CSV (flat file). Used the python library, Pyshark, to capture network interface packets. Programmed a UI around the given time series data to show graphs based on the timestamp, source IP, destination IP, destination port, protocol (TCP or UDP), data/control packet, and packet length.
